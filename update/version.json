{"version":"2.2.0","changelog":"<https://github.com/Xujiayao/MC-Discord-Chat/releases/latest>\n\n> This version requires additional permission from the Discord bot, \"Manage Webhooks\", compared to the previous versions. Please replace the `APP_ID` of the second link below with your Application ID (get it by accessing the first link), and access it to authorize the new permission. If you do not trust the link below, you may create one by referring to the MCDC docs.\n> \n> Regarding changes in the config file, this version dynamically creates MCDC Webhook and no longer requires manual creation when configuring MCDC, simplifying the steps of configuring MCDC and changing channels. Users not using Webhook may turn it off by setting the `useWebhook` option in the config file to `false`.\n> \n> In addition, users may customize the range of allowed in-game mentions. Clearing the `allowed_mentions` list disallows all in-game mentions.\n> \n> <https://discord.com/developers/applications>\n> \n> <https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=APP_ID&permissions=537054224&scope=bot%20applications.commands>"}
